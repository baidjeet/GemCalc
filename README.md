# Gem Buff Calculator

## Description
The Gem Buff Calculator is a simple GUI-based application that helps users calculate the combined power of their tools with gem buffs in a game. It allows users to select different levels of gems, input custom tool power levels, and even recommends the next best upgrade based on the user's current selection.

## Prerequisites
Before running the Gem Buff Calculator, make sure you have Python installed on your system. The program was developed with Python 3.11, but it should be compatible with Python versions 3.6 and above.

## Installation

### Installing Python
If you do not have Python installed, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download the latest version of Python for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### Running the Gem Buff Calculator
To run the calculator, you will need to clone the repository or download the source code. Once you have the code on your local machine, navigate to the folder containing the program files in your terminal or command prompt.

If you are using Git, you can clone the repository with the following command: https://github.com/baidjeet/GemCalc.git


After navigating to the directory containing the `gemcalc.py` file, run the program with: python gemcalc.py or use the calc.bat file.


If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you may need to specify the version, like so: python3 gemcalc.py


## Usage
Once the program is running, you will see a window with dropdown menus to select gem levels, a field to input a custom power level, and a display showing the calculated power. Use the dropdown menus to select the gem levels, and click on "Submit Custom Power" after entering a value to update the power calculation.

The program will also display the recommended next upgrade for increasing power most efficiently based on the current selection.
